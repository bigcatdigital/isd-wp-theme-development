							<p>On behalf of the entire International School of Dublin (ISD) it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our website.  Thank you for your visit. </p>
							<p>At ISD we appreciate the care and consideration families take to choose the best school for their child.  At the heart of our purpose is the overall wellbeing of each and every student.  We endeavor to ensure that all ISD students begin their educational journey with a solid foundation feeling safe, engaged and ultimately empowered and excited by the premise of discovering, creating and sharing knowledge.  
</p>
							<p>In an ever changing world, we are continually looking at the broader picture for the future.  Our aim is to set each student on an individual course for success.  We provide our students the space to forge their own path whilst equipping them with the essential skills to become autonomous lifelong learners.</p>		
							<p>Since our opening in 2007, we feel privileged and proud to have pioneered international education at the primary level in Ireland as the first International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IB PYP) school. We are passionate in providing a progressive educational option and our methods for success are adaptive.  With community spirit and partnership at the core, we are driven by the combination of a cutting edge, research based curriculum and an outstanding and dedicated team of international educators.</p>
