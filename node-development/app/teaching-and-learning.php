An IB education is based on a continuum which focuses on the total and unique growth of the developing learner encompassing social, physical, emotional and cultural needs in addition to academic development.</p>

						<p>	IB Mission Statement:  The International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. To this end the organisation works with schools, governments and international organisations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous assessment. These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.</p>
						<p>At the International School of Dublin (ISD) we strive for our students to be active inquirers, learners who are engaged in educational material and experiences. </p>
						<p>Throughout the curriculum, students are guided by the inquiry cycle.  The nature of a cycle is flexible and never ending, a process of which one may move forward, backward and in all directions.  The cycle provides opportunities for students to navigate their learning in a personally significant manner.</p>

					<div class="bc-expandible-block__intro__text">
						<p class="bc-expandible-block__intro__intro">The International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) was founded in Geneva, Switzerland in 1968 when a  group of educators, academics and parents created the Diploma Programme (DP).</p> 
						<p>The DP is an academically rigorous internationally recognised university entrance qualification. It has been adopted by many schools around the world, providing geographic and cultural mobility.

						<p>The organisation launched the Middle Years Programme in 1994 and the Primary Years Programme in 1997.  These programmes encourage a broad range of skills: critical thinking, multiple perspectives with inter- and trans-disciplinarity frameworks.</p>
						<p>In 2012, the Career-related Programme (CP) was introduced to run parallel and in conjunction with the Diploma Programme.  To provide more choice, this new programme offered strong academic content with vocational or technical programmes.</p>
						<p>All IB programmes share an international vision focused on global peace and understanding.  There are now more than one million IB students aged 3-19 in over 150 countries worldwide.</p>

						<p>Wellbeing is linked to all aspects of a student’s experience at school and beyond. It is paramount for our students to feel empowered by their learning, to value and take responsibility for their learning and to demonstrate resilience.</p>

						<p>Such learners are able to reflect on themselves, their experiences and the process of learning in order to demonstrate commitment to personal growth.</p>
						<p>Personal development permeates the entire curriculum and therefore is taught within the contexts of the Units of Inquiry as well as through teaching and learning experiences in other subject areas. The development of physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual and social health are important features of the curriculum.</p>
						<p>In addition, personal development is underpinned by the IB Learner Profile, which describes a broad range of human capacities and responsibilities that go beyond academic success.</p>
						<p>An understanding of one's own identity shapes one's concept of self-worth and affects his or her approach to learning and how he or she interacts with others. An understanding of and appreciation for other cultures shapes international-mindedness.</p>
						<p>At ISD we nurture independent thinking skills, which aim to help students develop self confidence and passion for learning. Interpersonal relationships are fundamental in all developmental aspects and we emphasise the importance of productive and healthy relationships.</p>
