				<p class="bc-content-component__intro">One of the fundamental goals of an education at ISD is to encourage a love of learning. Welcoming and lively learning environments are characterised by collaborative and purposeful activity.</p> 
				<p>Small class sizes are guided by international experienced teachers who work to facilitate holistic and innovative forms of engagement which promote learning that is process, rather than topic driven.</p>  
				<p>Ultimately, ISD students are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to become autonomous lifelong learners.</p>
				<p>All teaching and learning is guided by the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IB PYP). An IB education is based on a continuum which focuses on the total and unique growth of the developing learner encompassing social, physical, emotional and cultural needs in addition to academic development.  Therefore education at ISD is inquiry driven and student centred.  It is focused on promoting global contexts and life skills.</p>

						<p>	IB Mission Statement:  The International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. To this end the organisation works with schools, governments and international organisations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous assessment. These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.</p>
						<p>At the International School of Dublin (ISD) we strive for our students to be active inquirers, learners who are engaged in educational material and experiences. </p>
						<p>Throughout the curriculum, students are guided by the inquiry cycle.  The nature of a cycle is flexible and never ending, a process of which one may move forward, backward and in all directions.  The cycle provides opportunities for students to navigate their learning in a personally significant manner.</p>
