				<p>If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right off his desk!</p>

				</div>
				<p class="bc-inner-page-content__intro">The International School of Dublin (ISD) was established in 2007 to meet a need for educational diversity in Ireland.  At present our students are aged 3-12 and represent over 20 different nationalities.</p>
				<p>ISD is the only accredited IB World Primary School in Ireland. It is a small, private, non-profit school that is co-educational, non-denominational and culturally diverse.</p>
				<p>We believe that our school’s success is due to our internationally regarded curriculum (IBPYP) and the manner in which it is lived out by our students, staff and parents.</p>
				<p>At ISD you will find a welcoming and lively environment, which is characterised by collaborative and purposeful activity. ISD students benefit from an innovative form of schooling, a broad education that promotes inquiring, open-minded and principled learners who are reflective risk-takers.</p>
				<p>Small class sizes are guided by internationally experienced staff.  Students inquire into the world in which they live and ultimately development themselves as global, internationally-minded citizens. Our students are encouraged, guided and challenged to engage with real-life learning experiences. We aim for the success and achievement for each individual child.</p>
